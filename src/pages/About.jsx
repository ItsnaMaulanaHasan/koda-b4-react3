        <div>
          <p>ArchDesign Studio was founded in 1991 by the visionary architect, Adi Prasetyo, with a single mission: to create architecture that is not only functional but also tells a story and blends with its environment.</p>
          <p>
            For over three decades, we have grown from a small studio into a respected architectural firm, with a portfolio that includes iconic commercial buildings, comfortable residential homes, and innovative public spaces. Our team of
            talented designers continues to push the boundaries of creativity to bring our clients' dreams to life.
